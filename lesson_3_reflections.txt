When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	-Teamwork
	-No a free repository container to share, so use Github

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Then there will be many pull requests. And how often automatically pull will be a problem
